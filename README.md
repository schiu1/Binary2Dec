# Binary2Dec
- This App is a very simple Binary to Decimal convertor.
- Allows up to eight digits and lets the user know when the format is incorrect.

This App helped me in:
- Teaching me more about the fundamentals of Web Apps as this was my first one I completed.
- Refresh my knowledge of converting from Binary to Decimal.
